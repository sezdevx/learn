## FAQ

* When using a new github account, your pushes may be rejected due to the
old credentials being stored on windows, e.g. you changed your github account
and got a new one. [To solve the problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5335197/gits-famous-error-permission-to-git-denied-to-user)
go to Credential Manager and delete the credential associated with git.
Next time you push github will ask your new credentials and store them.

* On mac, check keychain and delete/change the github user name and password.
