* In insert mode you can insert any register by `Ctrl r` and then type the register name.

* Paste from system clipboard `"+p`

* To record a macro to a register `qa`, to stop recording the macro `q`. To look
at the contents of the register `:reg a` and to run it `@a` or `@@` to invoke

* To put the contents of a register `:put a`. You can edit the line
and store (yank) it back to a register with `0"ay$dd`.

* To ignore case in searches `:set ignorecase`. Per search pattern you
can use `\c` to ignore case and `\C` to force case sensitivity.

* You can also set the smartcase option `:set smartcase` where if
the pattern is all lowercase, the search is case insensitive, but
a single upper case letter forces ignoring case.

* To use a regular expression like perl's use `\v` flag e.g. `/\v([0-9]{3})

* To go to the next search result `n`

* To change the search direction `N`

* To capture a regular expression `/\v(\w+)\_s+\1`, to make sure that
we are talking about words `/\v<(\w+)>\_s+\1

* To turn off the special meanings of `. + *` symbols, use `\V` e.g.
`/Vhttp:\/\/domain.name/`, but you still need to escape some
characters like `\/ \?`

* To replace all occurrences of a searched text `:%s/test/text/g`.
To replace just one occurrence in the current line `:s/test/text`.
To replace all occurrences in a single line `:s/test/text/g`.
In order to confirm before a change `:%s/test/text/gc`

* Leaving the search text field blank tells vim to use the last
pattern.

" to turn on the encryption
:set key=secret (not a good idea)
" instead do this
:X

cat changes.vim
:%s/person/Jane/g

:set patchmode=.org
:set backupdir=~/tmp/
```

* To get a list of recoverable files
```
vim -r
" to get the swap file name for the current buffer
:swapname
" for turning off swap files
:set noswapfile
" configuring swap files
:set updatetime=23000
:set updatecount=400
```

* To control where the swap file is written
```
:set directory=/tmp (Not good to set it to /tmp, because names will conflict)
:set directory=.,/tmp
